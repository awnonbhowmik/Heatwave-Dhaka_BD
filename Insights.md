## Extreme Events Analysis

### Heatwave Redefinition

Traditional thresholds may underestimate heat stress. Our analysis uses multiple definitions:

| Threshold Type  | Temperature | Annual Days | Percentage of Year |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| 99th Percentile | 36.7°C      | 3.9 days    | 1.0%               |
| 95th Percentile | 34.9°C      | 19.3 days   | 5.0%               |
| 90th Percentile | 34.0°C      | 38.5 days   | 10.0%              |

Recommended threshold: 34.9°C (95th percentile) for policy and health planning applications.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that Dhaka is experiencing significant climate change impacts with accelerating trends in recent decades. The 0.76°C warming over 50 years, combined with 85,800 hectares of deforestation and increased climate volatility, creates a compounding environmental and public health challenge.

The asymmetric seasonal warming—with September showing +1.70°C change while January shows -0.58°C—suggests complex changes in monsoon patterns with implications for agriculture, water resources, and human comfort.

The extreme heat events of 2023 (52 heatwave days) provide a preview of future conditions if current trends continue. Immediate action is needed to:

1. Implement heat health protection systems
2. Restore urban forest cover
3. Adapt infrastructure for higher temperatures
4. Develop comprehensive climate resilience strategies

This analysis provides the quantitative foundation for evidence-based climate adaptation and mitigation planning for Dhaka's 22+ million residents.
