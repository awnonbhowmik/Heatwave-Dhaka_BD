# Analysis of Heatwaves in Dhaka, Bangladesh
<p align="justify">Climate change has increasingly intensified the frequency and severity of heatwaves globally, posing significant challenges to public health, urban infrastructure, and ecosystems. Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is particularly vulnerable due to its high population density, rapid urbanization, and inadequate heat-resilience planning. This repository is dedicated to analyzing heatwave trends in Dhaka from 1972 to 2024, providing insights into the factors driving these events and their impacts on society.</p>

## Overview
<p align="justify>This repository contains data and analysis related to the occurrence, intensity, and impacts of heatwaves in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from 1972 to 2024. It aims to provide insights into climatic trends, atmospheric factors, and the socio-economic consequences of heatwaves in the region.</p>

The dataset includes daily climate records for Dhaka Division, with key variables such as:
- **Temperature** (Maximum, Minimum, and Mean)
- **Precipitation** (Total)
- **Relative Humidity** (Maximum, Minimum, and Mean)
- **Wind Gust** (Maximum and Minimum)
- **Evapotranspiration**
- **Vapor Pressure Deficit**
- **Soil Temperature and Moisture**

The data spans over five decades and is structured to facilitate trend analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling.

## Objectives
1. Analyze historical and recent trends in heatwave occurrences in Dhaka.
2. Identify atmospheric and climatic drivers of heatwaves.
3. Assess the impacts of heatwaves on public health and socio-economic activities.
4. Explore mitigation and adaptation strategies for heatwave resilience.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Heatwave-Dhaka_BD.git
   cd Heatwave-Dhaka_BD
   ```
2. Explore the notebooks/ folder for Jupyter Notebook files analyzing the dataset.
3. View visualizations in the visuals/ folder to understand trends and correlations.
4. Access cleaned_data.csv in the data/ folder for structured and cleaned data.

## Dependencies
To reproduce the analysis and visualizations, install the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results
Initial findings suggest:
- A significant rise in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves over the past five decades.
- Humidity and wind patterns are critical factors influencing heatwave impacts.
- Mitigation strategies such as urban vegetation and public awareness programs can enhance resilience.
